## Introduction 📘

Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables systems to learn and make decisions without explicit programming. This repository aims to demystify the concepts behind machine learning by providing clear and concise implementations of various algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented 📚

Here's a list of the machine learning algorithms you will find in this repository:

- Linear Regression 📈
- Logistic Regression 📉
- Decision Trees 🌳
- Random Forests 🌲🌲
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🛡️
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 👥
- K-Means Clustering 🔶
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 🧮
- Naive Bayes 🧠
- Neural Networks 🕸️

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Usage 🚀
Each algorithm comes with its own script and a corresponding Jupyter notebook to demonstrate its usage. For example, to run the Linear Regression algorithm:
- Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts and notebooks to understand each algorithm better
